// In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.


// example 
let person = {
    name: 'munna',
    roll: 3543
}



// constructor function
function Website() {};

// literal notation
var Website = {};
