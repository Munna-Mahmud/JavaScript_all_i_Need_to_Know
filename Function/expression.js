// Function expressions are when you create a function and assign it to a variable. The function is anonymous, which means it doesnâ€™t have a name. For example:


let myFunction = function() {
    // do something
  };


// program to find the square of a number
// function is declared inside the variable
let x = function (num) { return num * num };
console.log(x(4));
